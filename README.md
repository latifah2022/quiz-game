# quiz-game

I have created a guiz game site.
[Github]( https://latifah2022.github.io/quiz-game/)

When you start the game it presents you with questions

When you answer the question correctly you move onto the next question and if you answer incorectly time is subtracted from the time.

When the timer reaches 0 the game is over. 

And then it askes for you intials and saves you score.
